# Bandersnatch  
bandersnatch game for my python course  
Game was written 100% in python 3.12+  
Has a version with AI (used for interactions with other characters) and a vesion without AI  

**TO USE AI VERSION**  
  Must install request library by doing "pip install requests"  
  Use llama3.2 3b version on ollama (https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2)  
  If you want to use another AI just edit line 45 by substituting "modello="llama3.2"" to your AI name (still use one from ollama tho)  
  To run the AI just go in your cmd and type "ollama run llama3.2" (or the name of your ai) and it will be running  
  Then thats it you can run the game with the AI interactions
